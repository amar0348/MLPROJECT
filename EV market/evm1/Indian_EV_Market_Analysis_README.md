# Indian EV Market Analysis

## 1. Project Overview
This dataset contains details about electric vehicles (EVs) available in the market. It is suitable for market analysis, clustering, and segmentation tasks. Each row represents an electric vehicle with features describing its performance, specifications, and price.

### Features:
- **Car_Name**: Name of the electric vehicle model.
- **Car_Price (in ₹ lakhs)**: Price of the car in lakhs of Indian Rupees (₹).
- **Battery_Cap (kWh)**: Battery capacity of the vehicle in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
- **Drive_Range (km)**: Maximum driving range on a single charge in kilometers (km).
- **Power (Bhp)**: Maximum power output of the vehicle in brake horsepower (Bhp).
- **Charge_Time (hrs)**: Time required to fully charge the vehicle in hours.
- **Transmission**: Type of transmission system used (e.g., Automatic, Manual, or other features).
- **Cluster (optional)**: Cluster assignment for each car after applying a clustering algorithm.

## 2. Market Analysis
